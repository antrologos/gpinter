<p>This application is an interface to the R package <code>gpinter</code>. It provides a set of tools to estimate and manipulate distributions of income and wealth based on tabulations of the data such as those provided by tax authorities. This program rely on the so-called “generalized Pareto interpolation” methods.</p>

<h2>Functionalities</h2>

<p>The application can be used for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Estimate an entire distribution based on the values of the quantiles and the top shares at a few points.</li>
    <li>Estimate an entire distribution based on the values of the top shares at a few points.</li>
    <li>Individualize the household distribution under equal sharing of income among spouses.</li>
    <li>Add up two components of income (say, labor and capital) assuming that the dependance between those two variables is characterized by a Gumbel copula.</li>
    <li>Merge the distribution between several countries.</li>
    <li>Simulate a random sample from the estimated distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The navigation bar at the top of the window gives you access to the different parts of the application.</p>

<p>You should start with the “Input data” panel. This is were you specify the data you want to process, and the type of processing you want. The input data must take the form of a set of properly formatted files (see <a href="#input-format">Input data format</a> for details). Each of them represent the tabulation for one distribution. They can be either in CSV or Excel (.xls or .xlsx) format. For Excel files, each sheet is read separately as if it were a distinct file. You can import you files into the application using the “Browse” button under “Import file(s)”.</p>

<p>Just underneath, you will find a green “Run” button. It will only be enabled once you have imported your input data.</p>

<p>Clicking that button will run the programs. </p>
