<p>This application is an interface to the R package <code>gpinter</code>. It provides a set of tools to estimate and manipulate distributions of income and wealth on the basis of simple tabulated data files (such as those provided by tax administrations and statistical institutes) and generalized Pareto interpolation methods.</p>

<p>The traditional Pareto interpolation method &mdash; first used by V.&nbsp;Pareto (1896) and then followed by S.&nbsp;Kuznets (1953), A.&nbsp;Atkinson and A.&nbsp;Harrison (1978), T.&nbsp;Piketty (2001, 2003) and the subsequent research literature on top income and wealth shares until recently &mdash; assumes that the distribution of income and wealth follows a Pareto distribution (or power law) with a constant exponent above a certain threshold. Typically, the inverted Pareto coefficient \(b(p)=\mathbb{E}[y|y>y(p)]/y(p)\) (where \(y(p)\) is the income or wealth quantile threshold corresping to fractile \(p\)) is assumed to be constant within the top 10% or top 1% of the distribution. This approximation is acceptable for some purposes but is generally not entirely correct. In addition, it cannot be used to interpolate the entire distribution.</p>

<p>In contrast, the <em>generalized Pareto interpolation</em> method is a flexible non-parametric method based upon the interpolation of a transformation of the full <em>Pareto curve</em> \(b(p)\), which does not need to be constant and can follow any shape. Providing that the input tabulation contains sufficiently many data points, the method provides very precise estimates of the full distribution. For a detailed presentation of the notion of Pareto curves and of the generalized Pareto interpolation method, <a href="http://wid.world/document/blanchet-t-fournier-j-piketty-t-generalized-pareto-curves-theory-applications-2017/" target="_blank">see T.&nbsp;Blanchet, J.&nbsp;Fournier and T.&nbsp;Piketty, “Generalized Pareto curves: theory and applications”, 2017</a>.</p>

<h2>Functionalities</h2>

<p>The application can be used for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Estimate an entire distribution based on the values of the quantiles and the top shares at a few points.</li>
    <li>Estimate an entire distribution based on the values of the top shares at a few points.</li>
    <li>Individualize the household distribution under equal sharing of income among spouses.</li>
    <li>Merge the distribution between several countries.</li>
    <li>Add up two components of income (say, labor income and capital income, housing wealth and financial wealth, male earnings and female earnings ) assuming that the dependance between those two variables is characterized by a Gumbel copula.</li>
    <li>Simulate a representative sample from the estimated distribution.</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" id="copula"></a>
<h2>Adding up income or wealth components using Gumbel copulas</h2>
<p>The interface has an option to add up components of income or wealth (for example, labor and capital income) with the assumption that the dependance between labor and capital income is characterized by a Gumbel copula. This option can be useful in countries where tabulations of the distribution of labor and capital incomes are available separately, but not jointly.</p>
<p>The Gumbel copula assumption means that the joint distribution of the rank in the first and the second components has the cumulative distribution function:
\[
F(u,v)=\exp\left[-\left((-\log u)^{\theta}+(-\log v)^{\theta}\right)^{1/\theta}\right]
\]
where \(\theta \in [1,+\infty[\).The higher \(\theta\), the stronger the dependence, with \(\theta = 1\) meaning full independence, and \(\theta = +\infty\) meaning perfect correlation of the ranks. In practice, a value of \(\theta=3\) approximates the dependance between labor and capital income quite well. For more information, see T.&nbsp;Blanchet, “Copulas and the joint distribution of incomes”, 2017 (forthcoming).</p>

<p>The navigation bar at the top of the window gives you access to the different parts of the application.</p>

<p><img src="img/navbar.png" alt="Navigation bar" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" height="51" width="983"></p>

<p>You should start with the “Input data” panel. This is were you specify the data you want to process, and the type of processing you want. The input data must take the form of a set of properly formatted files (see <a href="#input-format">Input data format</a> for details). Each of them represent the tabulation for one distribution. They can be either in CSV or Excel (.xls or .xlsx) format. For Excel files, each sheet is read separately as if it were a distinct file. You can import you files into the application using the “Browse” button under “Import file(s)”.</p>

<p><img src="img/import-files.png" alt="“Import file(s)” panel" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" height="107" width="574"></p>

<p>Just underneath, you will find a green “Run” button. It will only be enabled once you have imported your input data.</p>

<p>Clicking that button will run the programs. </p>
