}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A value between \code{min(xk)} and \code{max(xk)}.}

\item{xk}{The grid points for the spline estimation.}

\item{upperbound}{A function that majorates the third derivative.}
}
\value{
The value of the bound at x.
}
\description{
Gives the bound on the spline interpolation error
of the derivative for any point of the interpolation domain.
